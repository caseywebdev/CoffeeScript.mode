CoffeeSript.mode
================

This is a Coda/SubEthaEdit syntax coloring mode for the CoffeeScript language.

__Good news: Coda 2 is out!__

__Bad news: This mode is not compatible with it yet! I hope to get it working soon.__

I'll see what I can do 
 
Installation
============
 
- Download and unpack either the ZIP or TAR version of the CoffeeScript mode.
- Rename the unzipped directory to 'CoffeeScript.mode'.
- Coda:
  Manually copy the CoffeeScript.mode directory into ~/Library/Application\ Support/Coda/Modes/.
- SubEthaEdit:
  Open the CoffeeScript.mode file from within SubEthaEdit using the File > Open command 
  or by dragging the CoffeeScript.mode file onto the SubEthaEdit application icon in the dock.
